# VHP1946.github.io

"Homepage" for VHP technical documentation.

## Process
* Each repo to be tracked needs to have Pages enabled (requires Owner of Organization or Project)
* Each repo will monitor a certain branch and only update its page when that branch is updated (most likely "main")
* This repo acts as the main codebase for the "website"
  * index.html acts like any other webpage
  * links to other repos will need to be manually added
  * updating the "homepage" requires updating this repo
 
## Notes
* Repo orginization and documentation should be standardized, or all this becomes a mess
  * Only Admin can create new repos
  * Standard naming conventions
  * Only Admin can push to "main"
  * Commenting, README and CHANGELOG should always be consistantly kept up to date
* We can look in to having each page only update when the README is updated (via GitHub Actions)
* Be patient! It can take up to 10 mins for an update to publish
