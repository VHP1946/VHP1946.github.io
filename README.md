## Process
* Each repo to be tracked needs to have Pages enabled (requires Owner of Organization or Project)
* Each repo will monitor a certain branch and only update its page when that branch is updated (most likely "main")
* This repo acts as the main codebase for the "website"
  * index.html acts like any other webpage
  * links to other repos will need to be manually added
  * updating the "homepage" requires updating this repo
